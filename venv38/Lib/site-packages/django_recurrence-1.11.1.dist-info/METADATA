django-recurrence is a utility for working with recurring dates in Django.


Functionality
-------------

* Recurrence/Rule objects using a subset of rfc2445
  (wraps ``dateutil.rrule``) for specifying recurring date/times,
* ``RecurrenceField`` for storing recurring datetimes in the database, and
* JavaScript widget.

``RecurrenceField`` provides a Django model field which serializes
recurrence information for storage in the database.

For example - say you were storing information about a university course
in your app. You could use a model like this:

.. code:: python

   import recurrence.fields

   class Course(models.Model):
       title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
       start = models.TimeField()
       end = models.TimeField()
       recurrences = recurrence.fields.RecurrenceField()

You’ll notice that I’m storing my own start and end time.
The recurrence field only deals with *recurrences*
not with specific time information.
I have an event that starts at 2pm.
Its recurrences would be “every Friday”.


Documentation
-------------

For more information on installation and configuration see the documentation at:

https://django-recurrence.readthedocs.io/


Issues
------

If you have questions or have trouble using the app please file a bug report at:

https://github.com/django-recurrence/django-recurrence/issues


Contributions
-------------

All contributions are welcome!

It is best to separate proposed changes and PRs into small, distinct patches
by type so that they can be merged faster into upstream and released quicker.

One way to organize contributions would be to separate PRs for e.g.

* bugfixes,
* new features,
* code and design improvements,
* documentation improvements, or
* tooling and CI improvements.

Merging contributions requires passing the checks configured
with the CI. This includes running tests and linters successfully
on the currently officially supported Python and Django versions.

The test automation is run automatically with GitHub Actions, but you can
run it locally with the ``tox`` command before pushing commits.

1.10.3
------

* Add Hungarian localisation #161.

1.10.2
------

* Add Hebrew localisation #159.

1.10.1
------

* Update path to jQuery to match the one Django admin provides #148.

1.10.0
------

* Fixes and official support for Django 2.1 and 2.2 #143, #142;
* Remove support for Python 2.7 and 3.5, remove support for Django 2.0 #145.

-----

* Fix for using the recurrence widget in admin inlines #137.

1.8.2
-----

* Minor fix for Django 2.0 #134;
* Minor packaging fix #135.

1.8.1
-----

* Bad release, do not use.

1.8.0
-----

This release contains two backwards incompatible changes -
please read the notes below for details.

* django-recurrence now returns timezone aware ``datetime`` objects
  in most cases #130. If ``USE_TZ`` is ``True`` (it
  defaults to off with a stock Django install) then you'll now get
  timezone aware ``datetime`` objects back from django-recurrence. If
  you have ``USE_TZ`` as ``True``, and you don't want this behaviour,
  you can set ``RECURRENCE_USE_TZ`` to ``False``, but please let us
  know (via GitHub issues) that you wanted to opt out, so we can
  understand what your use case is.
* ``RecurrenceField`` instances without ``required=False`` will now
  require at least one rule or date. This change is intended to bring
  django-recurrence into line with how custom fields should
  behave. If you don't want to require at least one rule or date,
  just set ``require=False`` on your field #133.
* Improvements to avoid inline styles #85;
* Handle changes to ``javascript_catalog`` in Django 2 #131.

1.7.0
-----

* Drop official support for Django versions 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10;
* Fixes for saving ``None`` into a ``RecurrenceField`` causing a
  ``TypeError`` #89`, #122;
* Drop official support for Python 3.3 and Python 3.4;
* Provisional support for Python 3.7 (only for Django 2.0 and up);
* Ensure use of ``render`` on Django widgets always passes the
  ``renderer`` argument, to ensure support for Django 2.1 #125;
* Django 2.0 compatibility fix for usage of django-recurrence with
  Django REST framework #126.

1.6.0
-----

* Fixes for Python 3 #105;
* Support for Django 2.0 #109, #110;
* Switch back a couple of instances of ``DeserializationError`` to
  ``ValidationError`` #111;
* Switch around how we set dates in the date selector widget to avoid
  issues with short months #113.

1.5.0
-----

* Add Slovakian translations #98;
* Add support for events occurring at a fixed point before the
  end of the month - e.g. the second last Tuesday before the end of the month #88;
* Add minor style changes to make django-recurrence compatible with Wagtail #100;
* Allow changing the behaviour of generating recurrences on
  ``dtstart`` by default. You can opt in to this by setting
  ``include_dtstart=False`` on your ``RecurrenceField`` #93;
* Ensure broken values raise ``DeserializationError`` where expected #103.

1.4.1
-----

* Make PO-Revision-Date parseable by babel #75;
* Update installation notes to cover Django 1.10 #74;
* Add German translation #77;
* Add Brazilian translation #79;
* Ensure the migrations are included when installing #78;
* Fix order of arguments to ``to_dateutil_rruleset`` #81.

-----

* Improve our testing setup to also cover Python 3.5;
* Fixes for Django 1.10 #69.

1.3.1
-----

* Add Basque translations #67.

1.3.0
-----

* Drop official support for Django 1.4, Django 1.5, Django 1.6 and
  Python 2.6 (no changes have been made to deliberately break older
  versions, but older versions will not be tested going forward);
* Add official support for Django 1.8 and Django 1.9 #62;
* Fix for a bug in ``Rule`` creation where the weekday parameter is
  an instance of ``Weekday`` rather than an integer #57.

1.2.0
-----

* Added an option for events to occur on the fourth of a given
  weekday of the month #29;
* Fixed an off-by-one bug in the ``to_text`` method for events
  happening on a regular month each year #30;
* Fixed a bug in the JavaScript widget where the date for monthly
  events on a fixed date of the month had the description rendered
  incorrectly if the day selected was more than the number of days in
  the current calendar month #31;
* Added a French translation #32 - this may be backwards
  incompatible if have overriden the widget JavaScript such that
  there is no ``language_code`` member of your recurrence object;
* Added a Spanish translation #49;
* Added database migrations - running ``python manage.py migrate
  recurrence --fake`` should be sufficient for this version - nothing
  has changed about the database schema between 1.1.0 and 1.2.0;
* Fix broken tests for Django 1.4.

1.1.0
-----

* Added experimental Python 3 support.
* Added extensive test coverage (from 0% to 81%).

  which don't appear to have worked as expected for some time.
* Fixed a bug introduced in 1.0.3 which prevented the
  django-recurrence JavaScript from working #27.
* Don't raise ``ValueError`` if you save ``None`` into a
  ``RecurrenceField`` with ``null=False`` #22, for
  consistency with other field types.
* Make sure an empty recurrence object is falsey #25.
* Fix a copy-paste error in ``to_recurrence_object`` which prevented
  exclusion rules from being populated correctly.
* Fix a typo in ``create_from_recurrence_object`` which prevented it
  working with inclusion or exclusion rules.
* Various other very minor bugfixes.
